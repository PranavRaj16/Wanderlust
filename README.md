## 🌐 Deployment

For deploying Wanderlust to a production environment:
1. **Choose a hosting platform**: Platforms like Render, Heroku, or Vercel are suitable.
2. **Set environment variables**: Configure the necessary environment variables on your hosting platform.
3.**Database**: Ensure your MongoDB Atlas cluster is accessible from your hosting platform.
4.**Domain**: Set up a custom domain if desired.

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- **Environment Variables**: Never commit your .env file to version control. Use .gitignore to exclude it.
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated using Joi to prevent malicious data.
- **Authentication**: Sessions are managed securely, and sensitive routes are protected to ensure only authorized access.
